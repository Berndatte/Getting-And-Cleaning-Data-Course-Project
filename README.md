## Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project.

This repository is a **Berndatte Nthambi John** submission of getting and cleaning data course project.
The main goal is to collect and clean data for downstream analysis and sharing.

## Data

 - The data for the project can be downloaded through the following link: 
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

 - Full description of the data can be found at this site:

## Files

  - **CodeBook.md** describes the variables,data and the work that performed to clean up the data.
  
  - **run_analysis.R** contains all the coding for data preparation and the 5 parts of the course projects as follows:
  
    - Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
    
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    
    - From the data set in step 4,creates a second,independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    

 - **FinalData.txt** is the exported final data gotten from **run_analysis** after all the processes which the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
